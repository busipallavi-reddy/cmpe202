# Input Mask

I have implemented the decorator pattern for this use case. 

The views of the inputs get changed so with decorator I have wrapped the view with the decorators.

NumberDisplayDecorator class is the base decorator which is used to decorate the CreditCardNumber and CreditCardExp classes.
