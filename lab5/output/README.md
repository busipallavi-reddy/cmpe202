# Notes

There were 5 guys in the kitchen, apart from those in the counter. But they kept on exchanging roles, probably due to the rush.

Customer - Gives the order, pays the Worker 1 and collects burger from Worker 5.

Worker 1 - Takes the order, collects payment and gives receipt with order number.

Worker 2 - Prepares the buns for the burger and after they are done, adds sauce, and when patty is ready on the bun (kept by Worker 3), adds toppings and passes it to Worker 5 for packing.

Worker 3 - Grills the patties and puts them on the buns.

Worker 4 - Does the fries if the order asks to and gives them to Worker 5.

Worker 5 - Packs the burger and fries (if included in order), shouts the order number and delivers the order
